This project consists of 2 parts:

  - A c++ implementation of the Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption scheme from Brakerski and Vaikuntanathan
    _"Fully Homomorphic Encryption from Ring-LWE and Security for Key Dependent Messages"_ https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-22792-9_29


  - An implementation of our proposed algorithm to generate perfect parameters according to specific use cases from
     _Pre-Computing Appropriate Parameters: How to Accelerate Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption for Cloud Auditing_ https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8328713
